Our team, which gained our first jam experience in 48 hours during Jingle Jam organized by TEDU GDSC,
created a game called "Noel Kurye".

The theme was "Bring Back Christmas"
Objects: Santa Claus and water jug

Santa Claus, who could not distribute gifts because he ran out of money and could not bring back Christmas
as children were left without gifts, starts to earn money.

Graphic design: Rabia Calik
